            <h1>Rome Logo</h1>
            <h3 class="subheader">A logo designed for Rome, Italy</h3>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="two-thirds column">
                    <p>In this project, I was tasked with choosing a city and creating a logo that represented it. Rome
                        is an ancient city, that is rich with culture and history. I wanted to incorporate those
                        characteristics into this logo.

                        I began researching Rome's history, noting down important keywords as inspirtation. Main
                        concepts that I liked were Roman architecture and art. I had originally planned to create a
                        2-tone side profile of the statue of david. That was a weak concept, but I really liked the
                        profile idea.

                        I took some time to look into the origin myth of Rome; the story of Romulus and Remus which
                        inspired me to draw up concepts based around brothers and wolves.

                        I came out with this logo, which displays 2 side profiles with one vector to represent the two
                        brothers. I used references of roman facial features to re-create their signature hooked nose.
                        It represents Rome's history and its people.</p>
